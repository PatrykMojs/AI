# Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains a structured collection of machine learning projects developed during MSc studies in Artificial Intelligence and refactored into portfolio-ready workflows.

The projects cover:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time Series Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Experiment Tracking with MLflow
- Handling Class Imbalance
- Bias–Variance Analysis

The goal is to demonstrate practical ML engineering skills rather than academic lab submissions.

## 🧠 Overall Learning Path

The projects are intentionally structured to reflect increasing ML complexity:

1. Data understanding  
2. Time-series and feature encoding  
3. Dimensionality reduction and preprocessing  
4. Model comparison, tuning, and experiment management  

This progression mirrors real-world ML workflows:
EDA → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation → tracking.
